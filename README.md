# <ins>**AI Library Voice Assistant**</ins>

## **Overview**
The **AI Library Voice Assistant** is a **voice-enabled AI agent** designed to assist users in managing library-related tasks. It leverages **natural language processing (NLP)** and **speech-to-text/text-to-speech technologies** to provide an intuitive and hands-free experience for library users. Whether you're looking for **book recommendations**, checking **availability**, or **reserving** a book, this assistant makes library interactions **seamless** and **efficient**.

This project is built using **Python**, **SQLite** for **database management**, and integrates with **LiveKit** for **real-time voice communication**. It leverages **advanced language models (LLMs)** like **Groq's LLaMA 3** for generating **intelligent** and **context-aware responses**. For **voice interactions**, the assistant utilizes **APIs** such as **Cartesia** for **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, **Deepgram** for **Speech-to-Text (STT)**, and **Groq** for **natural language understanding** and **processing**.

<ins>*Note</ins>: The current interface for interacting with the **AI Library Voice Assistant** is the [LiveKit Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io/), which provides a simple and effective way to test **real-time voice communication**. While this serves as a great starting point, future iterations of the project may include a **custom frontend** for a more tailored and **user-friendly experience**.*

## **Goal**
The primary aim of this project is to explore and experiment with **modern tools** and **technologies** in the **AI** and **voice communication** space, rather than to create a fully fleshed-out **production-ready application**. Specifically, this project serves as a **learning platform** to:

- <ins>**Investigate LiveKit Toolkits**</ins>: Understand and utilize **LiveKit's real-time communication capabilities** for **voice interactions**.
- <ins>**Use Large Language Models (LLMs)**</ins>: Experiment with **large language models** like **Groq's LLaMA 3** to generate **intelligent** and **context-aware responses**.
- <ins>**Interact with Existing AI APIs**</ins>: Gain hands-on experience with **APIs** like **Cartesia (Text-to-Speech)**, **Deepgram (Speech-to-Text)**, and **Groq (LLM for natural language processing)**.
- <ins>**Create a Custom API**</ins>: Develop a simple **API** to handle **library-related tasks**, such as **book lookups**, **reservations**, and **recommendations**.
- <ins>**Build a Small Database**</ins>: Design and implement a lightweight **SQLite database** to manage **library data**.
- <ins>**Leverage Free Credits**</ins>: Utilize **free credits** provided by the tools (e.g., **Deepgram**, **Cartesia**) to build and test the project without incurring costs.

By focusing on these goals, the project provides a **practical way** to explore **cutting-edge technologies** while keeping the scope **manageable** and **cost-effective**.

## **Problem It Solves**
Managing **library resources** can be time-consuming and cumbersome, especially for users who prefer **quick** and **easy access** to information. Traditional library systems often require **manual searches**, **physical visits**, or navigating **complex online interfaces**. The **AI Library Voice Assistant** addresses these challenges by:

- Providing **instant access** to library information through **voice commands**.
- Automating **repetitive tasks** like **book lookups**, **reservations**, and **returns**.
- Offering **personalized book recommendations** based on user preferences.
- Making library services more **accessible** to users with **disabilities** or those who prefer **voice interactions**.

## **Features**
The **AI Library Voice Assistant** can perform the following tasks:

### 1. **Book Lookup**
- Search for books by **title**.
- Retrieve **detailed information** about a book, including its **title**, **author**, **genre**, and **availability**.

### 2. **Book Availability Check**
- Check if a specific book is **available** in the library.
- Provide **real-time updates** on book availability.

### 3. **Book Reservation**
- Reserve a book if itâ€™s **available**.
- Notify the user if the book is already **reserved**.

### 4. **Book Return**
- Facilitate the **return** of a reserved book.
- Update the **library database** to mark the book as **available**.

### 5. **Book Recommendations**
- Recommend books based on **genre**.
- Provide a list of **available books** in a specific category.

### 6. **Voice Interaction**
- Communicate with users through **natural language voice interactions**.
- Use **speech-to-text** and **text-to-speech technologies** for **seamless communication**.

## **How It Works**
1. **Voice Input**: The user interacts with the assistant using **voice commands**.
2. **Speech-to-Text**: The assistant converts the user's speech into **text** using **Deepgram's STT (Speech-to-Text)** technology.
3. **Natural Language Processing**: The assistant processes the text input using **Groq's LLaMA 3** language model to understand the user's **intent**.
4. **Database Query**: The assistant queries the **SQLite database** to retrieve or update **book information**.
5. **Text-to-Speech**: The assistant converts its response into **speech** using **Cartesia's TTS (Text-to-Speech)** technology and communicates it back to the user.

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
- **Python**
- **SQLite**
- **LiveKit API key**
- **Groq API key** (for **LLaMA 3**)
- **Deepgram API key** (for **STT**)
- **Cartesia API key** (for **TTS**)

### **Set up the environment** by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in the required values:

```plaintext
LIVEKIT_URL="your_livekit_url_here"
LIVEKIT_API_KEY="your_livekit_api_key_here"
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET="your_livekit_api_secret_here"
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
CARTESIA_API_KEY="your_cartesia_api_key_here"
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your_deepgram_api_key_here"
```
### Populate the database with your own book
with create_book() from db_library fill up your own SQL database

### Run the script
Run the agent:

```python main.py dev```
