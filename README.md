# AI Voice Assistant (LiveKit Playground)

## 🚀 Overview
This project is the **first iteration (MVP)** of an AI voice assistant built using **LiveKit**. It enables real-time voice interactions by integrating **speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and an LLM (Llama3)**. The assistant is designed for **concise and natural conversations**.

🔹 **Current Features:**
- 🗣️ **Real-time speech recognition** (Deepgram STT)  
- 🧠 **AI-powered responses** (Groq Llama3-8B)  
- 🔊 **Text-to-speech synthesis** (Cartesia TTS)  
- 🎙️ **Voice Activity Detection** (Silero VAD)  

🔹 **Planned Updates:** (already ongoing)
- 📚 **Library Assistance** – The AI will specialize in helping users navigate an **online library shop**, providing book availability, reservations, and recommendations.  
- 🗄️ **Database Integration** – A database will be added to store and manage book availability, reservations, and user interactions.  
- 🔗 **API Integration** – The assistant will be connected to an API to **automate tasks** like checking book stock, handling reservations, and responding to user queries dynamically.  
- 🛠 **Current Version:** This project is an MVP using **LiveKit Playground** to host the AI voice assistant. Future iterations might include self made frontend.
