# AI Library Voice Assistant

## Overview
The AI Library Voice Assistant is a voice-enabled AI agent designed to assist users in managing library-related tasks. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and speech-to-text/text-to-speech technologies to provide an intuitive and hands-free experience for library users. Whether you're looking for book recommendations, checking availability, or reserving a book, this assistant makes library interactions seamless and efficient.

This project is built using Python, SQLite for database management, and integrates with LiveKit for real-time voice communication. It leverages advanced language models (LLMs) like Groq's LLaMA 3 for generating intelligent and context-aware responses. For voice interactions, the assistant utilizes APIs such as Cartesia for Text-to-Speech (TTS), Deepgram for Speech-to-Text (STT), and Groq for natural language understanding and processing.


Note: The current interface for interacting with the AI Library Voice Assistant is the LiveKit Playground, which provides a simple and effective way to test real-time voice communication. While this serves as a great starting point, future iterations of the project may include a custom frontend for a more tailored and user-friendly experience.

## Goal
The primary aim of this project is to explore and experiment with modern tools and technologies in the AI and voice communication space, rather than to create a fully fleshed-out production-ready application. Specifically, this project serves as a learning platform to:

    Investigate LiveKit Toolkits: Understand and utilize LiveKit's real-time communication capabilities for voice interactions.

    Interact with Existing AI APIs: Gain hands-on experience with APIs like Cartesia (Text-to-Speech), Deepgram (Speech-to-Text), and Groq (LLM for natural language processing).

    Create a Custom API: Develop a simple API to handle library-related tasks, such as book lookups, reservations, and recommendations.

    Use Large Language Models (LLMs): Experiment with advanced language models like Groq's LLaMA 3 to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.

    Build a Small Database: Design and implement a lightweight SQLite database to manage library data.

    Leverage Free Credits: Utilize free credits provided by the tools (e.g., LiveKit, Deepgram, Cartesia, Groq) to build and test the project without incurring costs.

By focusing on these goals, the project provides a practical way to explore cutting-edge technologies while keeping the scope manageable and cost-effective.


## Problem It Solves
Managing library resources can be time-consuming and cumbersome, especially for users who prefer quick and easy access to information. Traditional library systems often require manual searches, physical visits, or navigating complex online interfaces. The AI Library Voice Assistant addresses these challenges by:

- Providing instant access to library information through voice commands.
- Automating repetitive tasks like book lookups, reservations, and returns.
- Offering personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.
- Making library services more accessible to users with disabilities or those who prefer voice interactions.

## Features
The AI Library Voice Assistant can perform the following tasks:

### 1. Book Lookup
- Search for books by title.
- Retrieve detailed information about a book, including its title, author, genre, and availability.

### 2. Book Availability Check
- Check if a specific book is available in the library.
- Provide real-time updates on book availability.

### 3. Book Reservation
- Reserve a book if itâ€™s available.
- Notify the user if the book is already reserved.

### 4. Book Return
- Facilitate the return of a reserved book.
- Update the library database to mark the book as available.

### 5. Book Recommendations
- Recommend books based on genre.
- Provide a list of available books in a specific category.

### 6. Voice Interaction
- Communicate with users through natural language voice interactions.
- Use speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies for seamless communication.

## How It Works
1. **Voice Input**: The user interacts with the assistant using voice commands.
2. **Speech-to-Text**: The assistant converts the user's speech into text using Deepgram's STT (Speech-to-Text) technology.
3. **Natural Language Processing**: The assistant processes the text input using Groq's LLaMA 3 language model to understand the user's intent.
4. **Database Query**: The assistant queries the SQLite database to retrieve or update book information.
5. **Text-to-Speech**: The assistant converts its response into speech using Cartesia's TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology and communicates it back to the user.
